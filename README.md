**Maze Game**

This Python script generates a random maze, solves it using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, and finds the shortest path from start to exit. The maze complexity increases with the level, and the game ensures the exit is reachable. It prints the maze and the minimum number of moves required to solve it.

**Installation**
1. Download the repository files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
3. Run `main.py` using Python 3.x.

**How to Play**
- Use the W, A, S, D keys or Arrow keys to move the player.
- Press 1 to start without AI
- Press 2 to start with AI
- Reach the exit (marked in red) at the bottom-right corner of the maze.
- The game gets progressively harder with each level.
- Press Q to quit the game at any time.

**Features**
- Procedurally generated mazes with increasing difficulty.
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Real-time score calculation based on performance.
