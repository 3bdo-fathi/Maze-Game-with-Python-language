# Maze Game

A fun and interactive maze-solving game that allows users to play manually or watch an AI solve the maze using a pathfinding algorithm. This project leverages Pygame for visuals and provides an exciting challenge with randomly generated mazes.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: Each game starts with a unique maze layout.
- **Manual Play Mode**: Navigate through the maze using keyboard controls.
- **AI Solver**: Watch the AI solve the maze step by step.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust maze size, difficulty, and player speed.

**Install Dependencies**:
1. Download the repository files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
3. Run `main.py` using Python 3.x.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame**
- **NumPy** (for maze generation)

---

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player in manual mode.
- **R Key**: Reset the maze.
- **A Key**: Activate AI solver.
- **Esc Key**: Quit the game.

## How It Works

1. **Maze Generation**:
   - Mazes are generated using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Prim's Algorithm, ensuring a unique path to the goal.

2. **AI Solver**:
   - The AI uses pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search or A*) to find the shortest path from start to finish.

3. **Game Loop**:
   - The game updates the player's position, redraws the maze, and handles user inputs in real-time.

## Future Improvements

- Add more difficulty levels.
- Include different maze themes and assets.
- Introduce additional game modes (e.g., timed challenges).
