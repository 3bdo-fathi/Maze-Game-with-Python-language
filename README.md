# Maze-Game-with-Python-language
This Python script generates a random maze, solves it using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, and finds the shortest path from start to exit. The maze complexity increases with the level, and the game ensures the exit is reachable. It prints the maze and the minimum number of moves required to solve it.
